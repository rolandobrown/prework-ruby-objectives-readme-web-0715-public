Programming allows you to automate common, repetitive tasks on the computer. Developers use programming languages to write software, the software you interact with every day. From your alarm clock to your computer; from the web to the satellites orbiting our planet, software powers all of it.

Ruby is a programming language that we can use to do any task that needs to be automated. For example, something that is really irritating is a cluttered "Downloads" folder on your Mac. We could write a program that moves a file to a new folder, based on it's file extension, whenever we download something. A "scripting-language" would be best suited for this task.

Ruby is one of the most popular languages to create web applications. A web framework is a tool that makes developing for the web relatively simple. The most popular web frameworks for Ruby are Sinatra and Ruby on Rails. All of these languages and web frameworks are considered server side languages as they will be run on an actual web server.

Here are the 5 Must Know Concepts of Programming:
